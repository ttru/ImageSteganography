ImageSteganography
==================

Simple image steganography project

This is a simple program used to hide an image within another image. This is accomplished by changing the image that will be 
hidden to grayscale, then storing the information about the luminance of each grayscale pixel of that image in the bits of the 
pixels of another image. The program can hide an image in another and then recover the (grayscale) hidden image.

* The idea for this project came from a part of an assignment from a Stanford introductory CS course.
